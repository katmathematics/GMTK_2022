# Licence to Yacht
### Designed and Developed by Alex Arnold and Katja Mathesius

Proof-of-concept RPG designed for the GMTK 2022 game jam, which had the theme "Roll of the Dice."

The game consists of a single RPG combat encounter, in which the gimmick of the game- attacking by playing the dice game Yacht, can be experienced. 

Play as James Yond, a secret agent cowboy from over yonder as he tries to take down the villainous mob boss Pierre Shorte- smuggler of loaded dice. Will Yond succeed or will Shorte's shady dice empire spread across the lands? Its all in the luck of the dice.
